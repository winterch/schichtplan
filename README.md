# Schichtplan

This is a very simple shift planer. An admin can define a plan with shifts and users can subscribe to one or more shifts. It can help to organize parties, festivals or political events. 

## About Schichtplan

Schichtplan was original developed by [o](https://code.immerda.ch/o) with [cakephp](https://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/index.html) framework back in 2011. The current version use [laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework) as a base and is compatible with modern php version (^7.3|^8.0). 

## Installation

You need to install the dependencies to run schichtplaner.
```bash
composer install
```

## Configure
To run schichtplan you need to configure a database and a mail backend. You can choose between different database vendors such as mysql, postgres or sqlite (see also [laravel doc](https://github.com/laravel/framework)). Add a `.env` file with your configuration and credentials.

Please change the APP_KEY. The easiest way to change the app_key is to run `php artisan key:generate`. This will set the APP_KEY in your .env file

```dotenv
APP_NAME=Schichtplan
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:YOU_NEED_TO_CHANGE_ME
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://schichtplan.com
LOG_LEVEL=info

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/path/to/laravel/database/database.sqlite
DB_FOREIGN_KEYS=true

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=null
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

After you generated the APP_KEY and configured your database connection, you have to run the databse migrations. This will setup or migrate needed database tables.

```bash
# Install or upgrade database tables
php artisan migrate
```

You should register a cronjob to cleanup plans without activity. For more information see the [laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/scheduling) 
```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1```
```
## Upgrade
To upgrade from an older version of schichtplan (< 2.0) you need to delete all old files and then upload the new one. Configure your database credentials and run the installation step. This should migrate your database tables. After this step everything should work as excepted, if not please open an issue.

## Commands
There is a command to clean up old plans. Most of the time you want to run this in a schedule and don't need to invoke it directly.
```bash
php artisan schichtplan:cleanup
```
